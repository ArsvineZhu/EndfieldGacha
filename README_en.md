## Notes

Some image assets are screenshots from **Arknights: Endfield**.

Original introduction to in-game gacha mechanics: [mechanics.md](doc/mechanics_en.md).

Some rules are **not detailed** in official explanations of Chartered Headhunting and Arsenal Issue. Therefore, **reasonable assumptions** have been made during development for the following parts:

### I. 10-Pull Pity Mechanism

The Chartered Headhunting banner has a rule: *“Every 10 headhunting attempts guarantee at least one 5★ or higher Operator”*.
The probability distribution between 5★ and 6★ on that guaranteed attempt is not specified, so two assumptions are considered:

#### (1) 5★ takes up 4★ probability; 6★ base probability unchanged (current implementation)

Example: First 10-headhunting attempt on a new Chartered Headhunting banner, no 5★ or higher in first 9 attempts.
10th attempt distribution:

```plaintext
6★:  0.80%
5★: 91.20%
4★:  0.00%
```

Example: Mid-banner Chartered Headhunting, no 6★ in first 68 attempts, no 5★ in previous 9 attempts.
Next attempt (69th):

```plaintext
6★: 20.80%
5★: 79.20%
4★:  0.00%
```

> **Rule**: If no 6★ Operator in first 65 headhunting attempts, 6★ probability increases by 5% per attempt starting from attempt 66, until guaranteed 6★ at attempt 80 (Soft Pity).

#### (2) Total 5★+6★ probability = 100%, remapped proportionally (discarded)

Example: First 10-headhunting attempt on a new Chartered Headhunting banner, no 5★+ in first 9 attempts.
10th attempt:

```plaintext
6★: ~ 0.91% ← 0.8% / (0.8% + 8%)
5★: ~90.91% ← 8.0% / (0.8% + 8%)
4★:  0.00%
```

Example: Mid-banner Chartered Headhunting, no 6★ in 68 attempts, no 5★ in previous 9 attempts.
Next attempt (69th):

```plaintext
6★: ~72.22% ← 20.8% / (20.8% + 8%)
5★: ~27.78% ←  8.0% / (20.8% + 8%)
4★:  0.00%
```

The second assumption clearly **does not match real gameplay experience** ~~and contradicts developer intent~~, so it is discarded.

The same first assumption applies to the Arsenal Issue banner for 10-Pull Pity.

### II. 6★ Probability Increase (Soft Pity)

Chartered Headhunting rule:
*“If no 6★ Operator in first 65 headhunting attempts, 6★ probability increases by 5% per attempt starting from attempt 66, until guaranteed 6★ at attempt 80.”*

It does not specify how 5★ and 4★ rates are distributed when 6★ rate rises. Two assumptions:

#### (1) 6★ takes up lower-rarity probabilities

Example: Mid-banner Chartered Headhunting, no 6★ in 68 attempts, 5★ already obtained in previous 9 attempts (10-Pull Pity not triggered).
Next attempt (69th):

```plaintext
6★: 20.80%
5★:  8.00%
4★: 71.20% (truncated)
```

At higher pull counts:

```plaintext
6★: 80.80%
5★:  8.00%
4★: 11.20% (truncated)
```

Further:

```plaintext
6★: 95.80%
5★:  4.20% (truncated)
4★:  0.00% (fully truncated)
```

This assumption distorts 5★/4★ ratios at high attempts.
Without real data, I cannot verify if this matches actual in-game results.

> **Premise**: Prioritize taking 4★ probability, not 5★. 5★ fisrt? NO WAY!

#### (2) Total 5★+4★ probability = 100%, remapped proportionally (tentative)

Example: Mid-banner Chartered Headhunting, no 6★ in 68 attempts, 5★ already obtained (10-Pull Pity not triggered).
Next attempt (69th):

```plaintext
6★:  20.80%
5★: ~ 6.38% ← 8% * (1 – 20.80%) / (8% + 91.2%)
4★: ~72.81% ← 91.2% * (1 – 20.80%) / (8% + 91.2%)
```

This preserves the 5★/4★ ratio and is more likely the actual implementation.

Without data, it is hard to confirm which is realistic. **Assumption 2 is used tentatively.**

## Statistical Conclusions

All results are from `demo.py` simulations, default sample size: **100K trials** unless noted.

### (1) Headhunting attempts needed to get Rate-UP Operator on a Chartered Headhunting banner

Probability distribution:
![Figure 1](pic/stats/Figure_1.png "Headhunting attempts needed to obtain Rate-UP Operator on a Chartered Headhunting banner")

**Conclusion**: Average headhunting attempts for Rate-UP Operator: **81.57**

- 1–65 (Early 6★): 22.70%
- 66–80 (Soft Pity): 33.09% (~1/3)
- 81–119: 10.08%
- 120 (Hard Pity): 34.13% (~1/3)

~~120-attempt Hard Pity is OFF THE CHARTS! What a monolith bar!~~

> Note: 10 free headhunting attempts (10-pull) from Urgent Recruitment are not used or counted.

### (2) Arsenal Issue attempts (1 attempt = 10 weapons) needed to get Rate-UP Weapon on an Arsenal Issue banner

Probability distribution:
![Figure 2](pic/stats/Figure_2.png "Arsenal Issue attempts needed to obtain Rate-UP Weapon on an Arsenal Issue banner")

**Conclusion**: Average Arsenal Issue attempts for Rate-UP Weapon: **55.49** (≈5–6 issue attempts)

- 10–20: 9.62%
- 20–30: 8.60%
- 30–40: 7.72%
- 40–50: 11.95% *
- 50–60: 7.12%
- 60–70: 6.31%
- 70–80: 5.71%
- 80–90: 42.95% *

> \* No 6★ Weapon in 3 Arsenal Issue attempts → guaranteed 6★ on 4th attempt
> \* No Rate-UP Weapon in 7 Arsenal Issue attempts → guaranteed Rate-UP on 8th attempt

### (3) Expected headhunting attempts for Rate-UP Operator (stopping at Soft Pity: 80 attempts)

Probability distribution:
![Figure 3](pic/stats/Figure_3.png "Expected headhunting attempts for Rate-UP Operator (stopping at Soft Pity, 80 attempts)")

**Conclusion**: Average pulls: **54.75**

> Note: 10 free headhunting attempts (10-pull) from Urgent Recruitment not counted.

### (4) Expected headhunting attempts for Rate-UP Operator (stopping at 119 attempts)

Probability distribution:
![Figure 4](pic/stats/Figure_4.png "Expected headhunting attempts for Rate-UP Operator (stopping at 119 attempts)")

**Conclusion**: Average attempts: **61.46**

> Note: 10 free headhunting attempts (10-pull) from Urgent Recruitment not counted.

### (5) Arsenal Ticket from 120 headhunting attempts on Chartered Headhunting banner

Probability distribution:
![Figure 5](pic/stats/Figure_5.png "Arsenal Ticket from 120 headhunting attempts on Chartered Headhunting banner")

**Conclusion**: Arsenal Ticket approximates a normal distribution.
Mean: **9411**, Standard deviation: **1591**

**Conclusion**: AIC Quota approximates a normal distribution.
Mean: **391**, Standard deviation: **71**

### (7) Number & rarity distribution of Operators from 120 Chartered Headhunting attempts

Probability distribution:
![Figure 7](pic/stats/Figure_7.png "Number & rarity distribution of Operators from 120 Chartered Headhunting attempts")

**Conclusion**: 6★ Operator count approximates normal distribution.
Mean: **2.09**, Standard deviation: **0.80**

Rarity rates:

- 4★: 84.98%
- 5★: 13.27%
- 6★: 1.74% (Rate-UP = 0.87%)

> Note: 10 free headhunting attempts (10-pull) from Urgent Recruitment not counted.

### (8) Number & rarity distribution of Weapons from 8 Arsenal Issue attempts

Probability distribution:
![Figure 8](pic/stats/Figure_8.png "Number & rarity distribution of Weapons from 8 Arsenal Issue attempts")

**Conclusion**: 6★ Weapon count approximates normal distribution.
Mean: **4.02**, Standard deviation: **1.44**

Rarity rates:

- 4★: 79.11%
- 5★: 15.87%
- 6★: 5.02% (Rate-UP = 1.255%)

### (9) Arsenal Ticket Distribution from 10 Headhunting Attempts of Urgent Recruitment

Probability distribution:
